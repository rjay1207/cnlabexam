Telnet:
TELNET (Terminal Network (or)Teletype Network) is the service that allows you to
access another computer by logging in to the remote system, such that, you can pass
commands to another system by sitting back at your place. It allows you to send the
instructions to a remote client, but in a plain-text format. Telnet listens to all the
requests by the user usually on TCP port 23.
Installation of Telnet:
Step 1: sudo apt-get install telnetd
This will complete the installation of Telnet. “telnetd” is a daemon that gets invoked
by “inetd” or its extension “xinetd”, both are the internet servers.
Step 2:
Then you are asked to enter the user password and then press enter. Processing will
start as soon as you press enter. After this, I have noticed a line “274 KB additional
disk space will be used” on the terminal screen.
You may also observe some sort of a message like this and then you”ll be asked to
continue or not. Just write “y” and then press enter to continue.
Step 3: Now when you are done with it, restart “inetd”. Type “sudo
/etc/init.d.open-bsd-inetd restart”.
“inetd” is daemon used for dealing with incoming network and it is responsible for
deciding which program to run when a request comes.
Step 4: To ensure “inetd” is started, press enter after writing the above command.
To connect with any remote client:
Step 5: Just type:“telnet hostipaddress”. For an example: “telnet 192.168.0.68” and
press enter.
Step 6: Then you”ll see, it is connected to “host ip address”. For security reasons,
you are required to provide “username” and “password” as well.
